  Well for starters, I found a tiny typo in a print statement. I kinda like my  method of the loop control better, though It might be a little less readable. I don't know... The other things I did was make the computer a little more ballsy, waiting till it reaches or exceeds 10 instead of 6, and changed the checks for a winning score to also stop when it exactly equals a winning score instead of going over.
